# Introduction
Project repository for LaundryLott web app. Powered by JavaScript, mySQL Database and Oracle Cloud.

With LaundryLott students enter a lottery for real money every week simply by chnaging over their laundry on time, and in the process helping colleges and communities by providing live laundry room status updates automatically.

Utilizing Oracle Cloud and Cloudflare to host the web app, with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap on front end, and JavaScript, mySQL, Git, and custom Logwrite NPM package in the back end.

For sustainability, LaundryLott uses low tier virtual machines and dns hosting to sustain affordability while not having to compromize on connectivity and latency.

## Using and Instructions

When designing LaundryLott over 6,500 lines of code were deleted and rewrote over the course of development, withe the sole intent of ease-of-use. In the final design, users only have to touch their phones a total of 3 times to use the app. The 3 touches as follows:
- Select input field
- Input a machine id
- Click start / finish

These are the core funcionality of the web app, but in addition there are some bonus features. The Laundry View button redirects users to another page where they can see a live view of the laundry machines status. Additionaly, users can report outages by inputting a machien ID and clicking the footer which reports the machine as out of order.

Creating an account is done automatically the first time you select start and from there you are set! Don't worry though, no personal information is collected.
